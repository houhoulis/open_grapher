Did not realize that calculating a "best fit" line is not a simple problem! Not even close.

(Feel free to ignore this section if you know about this statistical topic. Clearly I know very little.)

Even putting aside multi-variable analysis and other more complicated models, of which there are many, and just drawing a "best-fit" straight line, based only on the y-axis data. There are many models (with complicated math) based on what assumptions you can make about the data, and how you want to evaluate (minimize) the difference between any data point and the best-fit line.

Included because they are easy to understand:

Did not use, but another interesting method:

Did not use because it assumes the initial points are the most correct ("assign exponentially decreasing weights over time").
